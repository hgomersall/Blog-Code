### UPDATE: The bug seems to be caused by an Ubuntu 10.10 -> 11.04
### regression. I've no idea as to the cause, or even the exact symptoms
### (except to say that it seemed to caused by the Mesa driver - the 
### NVidia and ATI proprietary drivers worked fine).
### Those symptoms described below seemed to be the tip of the iceberg
### as regards what made it break. Adding the xorg-edges PPA to upgrade
### to the git version of various things has apparently made the problem
### go away. This is not ideal, but I (tentatively) consider the problem 
### solved.

Demonstrates a bug in using PyOpenGL in conjunction with QML.

Two bugs are apparent that both cause the program to hang with garbage
on the screen. The following cause the symptoms:

1) Importing GL in multiple files
or
2) Importing GL before numpy (even if numpy is not used explicitly in the
module)

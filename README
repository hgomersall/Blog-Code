Code examples from my blog.

All the code is licensed as liberally as possible subject to not
infringing the license on code that has been incorporated from 
other sources. The references are generally given in my blog and 
it should be possible to infer what the license will be with a 
little searching.

If the license is stated explicitely, its because the code
is under that license.

If in doubt, use the code for education and don't copy it
wholesale.

See hgomersall.wordpress.com for context.
